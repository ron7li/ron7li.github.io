Hi! I’m **Yue Li**, a second-year Master’s student in the [**Biomedical Engineering – Artificial Intelligence Engineering (BME-AIE)** Program](https://www.cmu.edu/bme/Academics/artificial-intelligence-engineering/index.html) at [**Carnegie Mellon University**](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Tai Sing Lee**](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/), with whom I work on computational models inspired by neural mechanisms in the visual cortex.

Before joining CMU, I completed my **B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence** at [**Wuhan University of Technology**](http://english.whut.edu.cn/), where I had the privilege of working with [**Prof. Bingyi Liu**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ECRF9DMAAAAJ&hl=en), [**Prof. Weizhen Liu**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a9P0p34AAAAJ&hl=en), and [**Prof. Nanqing Dong**](https://eveningdong.github.io/) ([Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/)).
